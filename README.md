This is a real-time digital piano synthesizer built entirely using mathematical waveform generation — **no prerecorded samples, no sound engines, no MIDI libraries**.

Every note is synthesized in real time using additive harmonic modeling and exponential decay envelopes, demonstrating practical applications of **Digital Signal Processing (DSP)** concepts.

# DSP Concepts Implemented

---

## 1. Digital Sampling Theory

Audio is generated digitally at:

- **Sample Rate:** 44,100 Hz  
- Meaning 44,100 samples per second  

Time vector per buffer:

```python
t = np.arange(frames) / SAMPLE_RATE
```

This converts discrete sample indices into continuous time.

---

## 2. Sine Wave Synthesis

Each note is generated as:

x(t) = sin(2π f t)

Where:
- f = frequency (Hz)
- t = time (seconds)

This produces a pure tone.

---

## 3. Additive Harmonic Synthesis (Timbre Modeling)

Real pianos are not pure sine waves.

We model richer timbre as:

sin(φ)  
+ 0.6 sin(2φ + 0.02)  
+ 0.3 sin(3φ + 0.03)

This adds:
- Fundamental → pitch perception
- 2nd harmonic → brightness
- 3rd harmonic → warmth

This technique is called **Additive Synthesis**.

---

## 4. Exponential Amplitude Envelope

Real piano strings decay exponentially.

Mathematically:

A(t) = e^(-t / τ)

Implemented as:

```python
envelope = np.exp(-age / decay)
```

This creates smooth, natural fade-out.

---

## 5. Frequency-Dependent Decay (Physical Modeling)

High notes decay faster in acoustic pianos.

Modeled as:

τ = BASE_DECAY × (SCALING / (f + SCALING))

Effect:
- Low frequency → long sustain
- High frequency → short sustain

This dramatically improves realism.

---

## 7. Phase Continuity

Each note stores its phase:

```python
note["phase"]
```

Why this matters:
- Prevents audio clicks
- Ensures waveform continuity
- Avoids buffer boundary artifacts

Without this, the sound would glitch.

---

## 7. Polyphonic Mixing & Loudness Normalization

All active notes are summed:

output = Σ wave_i

To prevent clipping:

```python
chunk *= VOLUME / np.sqrt(len(active_notes))
```

This keeps perceived loudness stable even when many notes are played.

#  Internal Execution Flow

1. User presses a key
2. Frequency is added to `active_notes`
3. Audio callback continuously runs
4. For each buffer:
   - Generate sine waves
   - Add harmonics
   - Apply exponential envelope
   - Sum active notes
   - Normalize volume
5. Buffer is streamed to output device

All operations occur in real time.
